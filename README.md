route-loader
============

Simple route loader for express. Enables you to list your routes on a json file instead of adding code to your main application file for each new route.


Simple usage
==========

First off we import the package on our app.js file.

```
router = require('route-loader')
```

Then you can change that default routes code generated by express:

```
app.get('/', routes.index);
app.get('/users', user.list);
```

To this call:

```
router(app);
```

Now you can define your routes on a file name "routes.json". It will look like this:

```
{
    "get /": {
        "route": "index.index"
    },
    "get /admin": {
        "route": "index.index"
    }
}
```
